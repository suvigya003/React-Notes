React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Components return JSX.
- Components can have state which is an object that dteremines how a component renders/behaves.
   Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
   Create a Function component called Car
   function Car() {
      return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
   }
- Props are like function arguments, and you send them into the component as attributes.
   Use an attribute to pass a color to the Car component, and use it in the render() function:

function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a {props.color} Car!</h2>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car color="red"/>);
- Context API is used to manage a lot of states in components.
- React hooks are react functions that let us hook into React state from function components.
- useEffect- fetches HTTP requests when page reloads / does something at page reload.
- useState- returns a stateful value and a function to update it.
- const name=Ram
   return(
    <h2>{name}</h2>     // to access js elements use {}
  )
- Web page / UI is just a bunch of components.
- Styling:
   return(
   <h1 style={styling}>Hello</h1>)     // <h1> is a component
   const styling={    // styling is a variable
   color:'red'
   }
 - props:
   App.js
   <header color='red'/>
   <header color='green'/>       //reusing of components output-- 2 times Hello
   Header.js
   <div style={{backgroundColor:color}}>Hello</div>
   
 - Props are arguments passed into React components.
   React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
   const myElement = <Car brand="Ford" />;
   
 - Events:
   function Football() {
  const shoot = () => {          //shoot is an event handler function
    alert("Great Shot!");
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={shoot}>Take the shot!</button>
  );
}
