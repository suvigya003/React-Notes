React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Components return JSX.
- Components can have state which is an object that dteremines how a component renders/behaves.
- Context API is used to manage a lot of states in components.
- React hooks are react functions that let us hook into React state from function components.
- useEffect- fetches HTTP requests when page reloads.
- useState- returns a stateful value and a function to update it.
- const name=Ram
   return(
    <h2>{name}</h2>     // to access js elements use {}
  )
